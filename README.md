# System-solver
Solves 2 variable, 2 equation system.
Input using one space between each term and omit plus signs as they will be added automaticly with no other sign.
You will have to put the a minus sign directly in front of a term with no spaces for it to register the term as a negitive.
For example, if I have:
y = 2x + 3
y = -6x - 4
Then, I will input:
y = 2x 3
y = -6x -4
